Current_Probe

A poor man's current probe

Quick specs:

Sensor rated at +-50A nominal, although according to the datasheet it will easily do +-100A. The rest of the circuit is designed for +-100A.
Bandwidth: DC to 100kHz (-3dB) dictated by the sensor.
Batteries: 2P1S 18650 li-ion. 500mA charging current via USB.
Sensivity: 10A/V
Output impedance: 50ohms
